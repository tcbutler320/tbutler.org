> *A consultant and developer at Deloitte, and freelance security researcher for Hackerone* 

Tyler received his undergraduate degrees from The Pennsylvania State University in Security and Risk Analysis and Criminology. At Deloitte, he modernizes mainframe applications by refactoring legacy assembly/cobol code to Java.   

In a professional capacity I am broadly focused on studying information security, with plans to complete my OSCP certification and continue studies in graduate school. 

My academic interests include;

+  Cryptocurrency, Blockchain and National Security
+  Vulnerability Research and Exploit Developement
+  Geopolitical Impact of Offensive Cyber Operations

In my free time I participate in Cyber Capture the Flag events both solo and with my current team, [0x90skids](https://0x90skids.com). I also maintain several open source repositories on GitHub.
