I'm a cyber risk consultant with experience in penetration testing, working towards my Master's degree in Security Studies at <a class="highlighted" href="https://css.georgetown.edu/academics/ssp/">Georgetown's Walsh School of Foreign Service</a>, focused on Technology, Security, and Eastern Europe. In my free time, I conduct independent vulnerability research and have been credited with several CVE's including CVE-2021-35956 and CVE-2021-3441, and was nominated to the 2021 Motorola Solutions Bug Bounty Hall of Fame.
